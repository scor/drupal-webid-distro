Drupal WebID distribution
=========================

This distribution exists to get people interested in WebID and Drupal started
quickly. It includes all the necessary modules and third party libraries
required to:
* use Drupal as a WebID provider allowing you to authenticate to other WebID
enabled sites
* register and/or log in Drupal using your existing WebID (which may or may
not be provided by Drupal at the first place)

In particular, this distribution includes the
[Drupal WebID module](http://drupal.org/project/webid)
and the third party libraries [libAuthentication](https://github.com/melvincarvalho/libAuthentication),
[ARC2](https://github.com/semsol/arc2) and [Graphite](http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/).
You can of course download each of these separately to your existing Drupal site.
The versions of the libraries packaged here are known to work with Drupal,
so this distribution provides a good testbed for evaluating WebID in Drupal.
