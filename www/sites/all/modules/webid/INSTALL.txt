PREREQUISITES
-------------
* Before using the WebIdauth module, please make sure you have a working installation of an 
authentication service, like the one at https://auth.fcns.eu/auth/index.php
To setup the service, you will need to create an SSL - enabled virtual host on your server 
configuration and enable client certificate handling. To get WebIDauth service up and running, 
you will also need the public - private key pair of your WebID auth server. The private key path 
should be accessible from WebIDauth service and configured in its index.php.  For further 
information, review the documentation in https://github.com/WebIDauth/WebIDauth

* Make sure you have the Libraries API (http://drupal.org/project/libraries) module installed 
and have downloaded the following libraries:

1. libAuthentication (WebIDauth fork: https://github.com/WebIDauth/libAuthentication)
2. ARC2 library (https://github.com/semsol/arc2/)
3. Graphite RDF library (http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/)

and installed them in the /sites/all/libraries directory. The path to libAuthentication's config
.php should be /sites/all/libraries/libAuthentication/config.php , while the path to ARC's ARC2
.php should be sites/all/libraries/ARC2/arc/ARC2.php , per the rdfx module recommendation. 
The path to
graphite's  Graphite.php should be sites/all/libraries/Graphite/Graphite.php

Please configure lib/Authentication_X509CertRepo.php to match your certificate pair, by 
entering your public key.

INSTALLATION
------------
1. Download and install the module from drupal.org, using the Modules administration panel, or 
any other preferred way
2. Enable the module in Modules administration panel
3. Set the authentication service URL in admin/config/people/webidauth
